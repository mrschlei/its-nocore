FY1617: Multifactor Authentication Expansion,"The University of Michigan has recently been the victim of a number of phishing scams.

Today, the University uses SecurID from RSA as its two-factor authentication system for users that need access to sensitive information or systems. The current RSA product is limited in its functionality. The University could increase the adoption of two-factor authentication among faculty, staff, and students by offering a wider range of two-factor authentication methods, which will lead to a more secure environment.

This investment request is a proposal to replace the University’s RSA two-factor authentication solution with Duo. The project will include:

Foundational Services integration with AWS,"We are wrapping up the Operationalize AWS project that was intended to familiarize ITS ISO with the AWS platform. This project would build on what was learned. Starting with ISO we would do an inventory/analysis of applications and services. The goal would be to identify which ones would provide the biggest benefit to ITS and campus if they were moved, or made redundant with AWS services. The effort would identify some number of these to integrate with AWS, while trying to create a template/process for future integration of applications. This will greatly improve our understanding of AWS and allow us to move more quickly in the future when Cloud infrastructure is the best option. This project will also allow us to document and reuse criteria for identifying which applications are best fit for on, or off site cloud services.",Open/Approved,77,3/7/2017,Green,"Chapman,Mandie M",ITS,"Palms,Andrew T"
Campus Wide WiFi Upgrade,"Students, faculty, staff, and administrators agree that current WiFi networks are inconsistent and insufficient to meet the demands of an increasingly mobile and collaborative learning environment.

The University of Michigan IT Executive Council has been asked to consider an additional $24.4 million WiFi Network upgrade project including 275 academic, research, administrative and residence hall buildings on the Ann Arbor campus. This effort continues progress to provide consistent coverage in facilities where the majority of teaching, learning, research, and work occurs across campus.

The 275 buildings that have been recommended by ITS for upgrades to their WiFi netowrks are listed in priority order. The actual order that buildings are upgraded, however, has to do with many factors such as when the building is available for construction activity and when the building may be undergoing renovations. Each building is subject to final CIO and Provost office approval when a more detailed building evaluation and construction cost estimate is completed.

In answer to this concern, the University of Michigan Provost has approved three capital investment projects. These projects are to provide one-time funding for WiFi network upgrades. This effort will establish pervasive connectivity in libraries, public-facing university buildings, residence halls and academic spaces critical to our student services and academic missions.

Campus WiFi Upgrade Projects are significant initiatives designed to bring the network to a consistent standard of coverage, capacity, and capability. Achieving these standards will permit our students, faculty, and staff to teach, learn, and work anytime and anywhere in these facilities. Upgrades will also deliver a consistently positive WiFi experience for our prospective students, parents, alumni, and guests.

Not included in these projects are funding to improve networks in the University of Michigan Health System, U-M Dearborn, and U-M Flint campuses.Improved user experience;
Consistent coverage provided;
Improved reliability;
Increased capacity with more access points and more spectrum;
Device location information to enable future applications provided;
Service based on factors such as the user, the device, the location of the device or the service being used provided; and
Improved the ability to diagnose user access issues
In total, this project will affect 458 buildings in Ann Arbor, 171 of which are classroom, research or administrative buildings. The remainder are housing (253) and athletics (34). The secondary proposal is to provide on-going funding to ITS to upgrade the Wi-Fi electronics every five years.",Open/Approved,99,8/2/2018,Green,"Vimawala,Alok",All Units,"Palms,Andrew T"
Cellular Coverage Analysis (MCoverage),"The University's decision to discontinue use of Extenet as an intermediary for distributed networks for use by wireless carriers has raised the priority of this work. This project will help us assess the cellular coverage for each carrier on our campus.  That information is critical as we decide on a path forward.  We can hire an outside company to provide us that information on a one time basis for $200K.  This project, however, can provide us that information on an on-going basis while also benefiting one of our faculty.",Open/Approved,100,4/25/2017,Green,"cors,brian",OVP Research,"Palms,Andrew T"

FY1610: Oracle Exadata Security,"The Institutional Data Access & Management section of the IT Strategic Plan emphasizes the importance of more open access to data for faculty, students, and staff   As availability of data is increased, it becomes imperative that we take precautions to protect sensitive data.
Data breaches are becoming common. Universities and corporations are targeted by hackers daily.  Assessment of our current data and database security practices has identified risks which require technology and staffing resources to address. 
Implementing preventive measures to protect UM sensitive data decreases the risk of data loss, lawsuits, and costly notification and credit protection.   Implementing additional security measures for databases as well as providing safe-harbor provisions in the event of an attack.

The purpose of this project is to:
*Implement a database firewall to restrict data access from unauthorized sources.  
*Deliver an automated auditing tool that will detect and alert on suspicious activities.  
*Decrease duplication of sensitive data in downstream databases. ",Open/Approved,47,8/1/2017,Green,"Thomas,Katarina Kt",ITS,"Palms,Andrew T"
